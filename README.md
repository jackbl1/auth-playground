## Auth Playground

Auth Playground is a NextJS App built by Jack Bloomfeld. After noticing many new software engineers struggling with auth, confused between different options, and unclear the best way to integrate, I decided to make this app as a way to help people learn about auth.

## Auth Options

Currently the app supports the following auth options:

- Firebase
- MagicLink
- Paper.xyz

Coming soon:

- Peaze
- Web3Auth

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
