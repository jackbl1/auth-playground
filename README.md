This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Auth Playground

Auth Playground is a NextJS App built by Jack Bloomfeld. After noticing many new software engineers struggling with auth, confused between different options, and unclear the best way to integrate, I decided to make this app as a way to help people learn about auth.

## Auth Options

Currently the app supports the following auth options:
Firebase Auth

- email
- google

MagicLink

- in progress

Web3Auth

- in progress

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) is an endpoint that uses [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello/route.ts`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
